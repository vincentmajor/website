There remains sparse transparent reporting of model generalizability in different subpopulations especially for implemented systems.\n**Methods**: A prognostic study included adult admissions at a multi-site, academic medical center between 2015 and 2017. A predictive model for all-cause mortality (including initiation of hospice care) within 60 days of admission was developed. Model generalizability is assessed in temporal validation in the context of potential demographic bias. A subsequent prospective cohort study was conducted at the same sites between October 2018 and June 2019. Model performance during prospective validation was quantified with areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves stratified by site. Prospective results include timeliness, positive predictive value, and the number of actionable predictions.\n**Results**: Three years of development data included 128,941 inpatient admissions (94,733 unique patients) across sites where patients are mostly white (61%) and female (60%) and 4.2% led to death within 60 days. A random forest model incorporating 9614 predictors produced areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves of 87.2 (95% CI, 86.1–88.2) and 28.0 (95% CI, 25.0–31.0) in temporal validation. Performance marginally diverges within sites as the patient mix shifts from development to validation (patients of one site increases from 10 to 38%). Applied prospectively for nine months, 41,728 predictions were generated in real-time (median [IQR], 1.3 [0.9, 32] minutes). An operating criterion of 75% positive predictive value identified 104 predictions at very high risk (0.25%) where 65% (50 from 77 well-timed predictions) led to death within 60 days.\n**Conclusion**: Temporal validation demonstrates good model discrimination for 60-day mortality. Slight performance variations are observed across demographic subpopulations. The model was implemented prospectively and successfully produced meaningful estimates of risk within minutes of admission.","tags":["Machine Learning","End-of-life"],"title":"Development, implementation, and prospective validation of a model to predict 60-day end-of-life in hospitalized adults upon admission at three sites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent J.

We conduct experiments to quantify the effects of experimental design choices, namely cohort selection and internal validation methods, on (estimated) real-world model performance.\n**Materials and Methods**: Four years of hospitalizations are used to develop a 1-year mortality prediction model (composite of death or initiation of hospice care). Two common methods to select appropriate patient visits from their encounter history (backwards-from-outcome and forwards-from-admission) are combined with 2 testing cohorts (random and temporal validation). Two models are trained under otherwise identical conditions, and their performances compared. Operating thresholds are selected in each test set and applied to a “real-world” cohort of labeled admissions from another, unused year.\n**Results**: Backwards-from-outcome cohort selection retains 25% of candidate admissions (n = 23 579), whereas forwards-from-admission selection includes many more (n = 92 148). Both selection methods produce similar performances when applied to a random test set. However, when applied to the temporally defined “real-world” set, forwards-from-admission yields higher areas under the ROC and precision recall curves (88.3% and 56.5% vs. 83.2% and 41.6%).\n**Discussion**: A backwards-from-outcome experiment manipulates raw training data, simplifying the experiment. This manipulated data no longer resembles real-world data, resulting in optimistic estimates of test set performance, especially at high precision. In contrast, a forwards-from-admission experiment with a temporally separated test set consistently and conservatively estimates real-world performance.\n**Conclusion**: Experimental design choices impose bias upon selected cohorts. A forwards-from-admission experiment, validated temporally, can conservatively estimate real-world performance.","tags":["Machine Learning","End-of-life"],"title":"Estimating Real World Performance of a Predictive Model: A Case-Study in Predicting End-of-Life","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent J.

During the 4 weeks, we present basics in R and guide the students to start an analysis usually using a publically available dataset. One dataset that comes up every year is SEER from the National Cancer Institute.\nBut, there's a problem. SEER suggests you use their software, SEER*Stat, which requires you to use Windows. They do provide data in an alternative \u0026quot;ASCII text format\u0026quot; but provide little guidance for new users to get started.\nReading text files Reading data into R is full of pitfalls for any new programmer:\n multi-line headers, atypical delimiters, odd field types (e.g. Excel dates). leading zeros / whitespace, atypical values for missing data, ...  SEER throws another curveball because their \u0026quot;ASCII text format\u0026quot; is actually a fixed width file!\nFixed width files Most text based data files use a delimiter (otherwise known as a separator; e.g. commas, semicolons, spaces, or tabs) that marks the end of one field and the start of the next. On the other hand, a fixed width file (FWF) specifies the position or width of each field.\nFor example, here is a file where the first field is 20 characters long, the second field is 10 characters long and the third, and final, field is another 12 characters long.\nJohn Smith WA 418-Y11-4111 Mary Hartford CA 319-Z19-4341 Evan Nolan IL 219-532-c301  To make FWFs even more complicated, they often don't use a header to specify the field names. Since the user is supposed to know the field positons, they should also know the field names.\nWith the field names and positions (or widths), we can load the file and it should look like this:\n   Name State SSN     \u0026quot;John Smith \u0026quot; \u0026quot;WA \u0026quot; \u0026quot;418-Y11-4111\u0026quot;   \u0026quot;Mary Hartford \u0026quot; \u0026quot;CA \u0026quot; \u0026quot;319-Z19-4341\u0026quot;   \u0026quot;Evan Nolan \u0026quot; \u0026quot;IL \u0026quot; \u0026quot;219-532-c301\u0026quot;    R code The readr::read_fwf() function is great for reading FWFs. The format is very similar to the rest of readr (and, in turn, the rest of the tidyverse) and you can specify the field names and positions in your favorite way or let read_fwf guess for you.\nlibrary(readr) read_fwf(fwf_sample, fwf_cols(name = 20, state = 10, ssn = 12) )  Which returns a tibble that looks like:\n# A tibble: 3 x 3 name state ssn \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; 1 John Smith WA 418-Y11-4111 2 Mary Hartford CA 319-Z19-4341 3 Evan Nolan IL 219-532-c301  You'll notice that read_fwf trimmed the whitespace from the end of each field too (\u0026quot;John Smith\u0026quot; rather than \u0026quot;John Smith \u0026quot;), which is nice.\nReading SEER data So, how do you apply this to SEER if we don't know the column names and positions?\nYou can't.\nBut, each SEER \u0026quot;ASCII text file\u0026quot; comes with a .sas script that can be used to read the file into SAS. Here's an example that looks like this:\n*filename seer21 './yr2000_2016.seer21/*.TXT'; data in; infile seer21 lrecl=87; input @ 1 PUBCSNUM $char8. /* Patient ID */ @ 9 REG $char10. /* SEER registry */ @ 19 RACE1V $char2. /* Race/ethnicity */ @ 21 SEX $char1. /* Sex */ ...  Now I don't know SAS but I can see what this code is doing. Each line after input defines one field and it's:\n start position, field name, field type (and length/precision [the number after \u0026quot;char\u0026quot;]), and a bonus description of the field.  With this .sas file we have everything we need to read the entire file.\nProgrammatically extracting field information We can use R to extract the 4 components that describe each field in the .sas file.\nUsing tidyverse again here:\nsas.raw \u0026lt;- read_lines(sas.file) sas.df \u0026lt;- tibble(raw = sas.raw) %\u0026gt;% ## remove first few rows by insisting an @ that defines the start index of that field filter(str_detect(raw, \u0026quot;@\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% ## extract out the start, width and column name+description fields mutate(start = str_replace(str_extract(raw, \u0026quot;@ [[:digit:]]{1,3}\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;@ \u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;), width = str_replace(str_extract(raw, \u0026quot;\\\\$char[[:digit:]]{1,2}\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;\\\\$char\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;), col_name = str_extract(raw, \u0026quot;[[:upper:]]+[[:upper:][:digit:][:punct:]]+\u0026quot;), col_desc = str_trim(str_replace(str_replace(str_extract(raw, \u0026quot;\\\\/\\\\*.+\\\\*\\\\/\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;\\\\/\\\\*\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;\\\\*\\\\/\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot; )) ) %\u0026gt;% ## coerce to integers mutate_at(vars(start, width), funs(as.integer)) %\u0026gt;% ## calculate the end position mutate(end = start + width - 1)  (I'm assuming sas.file is either a link to a file online, such as \u0026quot;https://seer.cancer.gov/manuals/read.seer.limitedfield.research.nov2018.sas\u0026quot;, or a local file, such as \u0026quot;path/to/file/example.sas\u0026quot;)\nAnd with that we have a sas.df data frame (or tibble) that looks like:\n# A tibble: 35 x 6 raw start width col_name col_desc end \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 1 \u0026quot; @ 1 PUBCSNUM $char8. /* Patient ID */\u0026quot; 1 8 PUBCSNUM Patient ID 8 2 \u0026quot; @ 9 REG $char10. /* SEER registry */\u0026quot; 9 10 REG SEER registry 18 3 \u0026quot; @ 19 RACE1V $char2. /* Race/ethnicity */\u0026quot; 19 2 RACE1V Race/ethnicity 20 4 \u0026quot; @ 21 SEX $char1. /* Sex */\u0026quot; 21 1 SEX Sex 21  Most importantly, sas.df contains start (and width) values and names for each field that we can directly use to read the whole file:\n## read the file with the fixed width positions data.df \u0026lt;- read_fwf(file_path, fwf_positions(sas.df$start, sas.df$end, sas.df$col_name))  And we're done!\nSummary I've used this template to help several different people start different SEER projects over the years and as long as you can find a .sas file that matches your data, this will work with almost no effort. However, different SEER datasets have different formats so take care to check.\nA simple script is up on github here. Don't forget to change the .sas file/link and the file path to your own copy of whichever SEER dataset.\n","date":1542153600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542153600,"objectID":"78beaf9ae3fca070f4c6f8e2561d1170","permalink":"https://vincentmajor.com/post/2019-11-14_seer_read_fwf/","publishdate":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-11-14_seer_read_fwf/","section":"post","summary":"I help teach a class each summer which serves as an introducion to biomedical informatics and programming for, mostly resident, physicians.

Recent algorithms such as word2vec and fastText are capable of learning semantic meaning and similarity between words in an entirely unsupervised manner using a contextual window and doing so much faster than previous methods. Each word is represented as a vector such that similar meaning words such as ‘strong’ and ‘powerful’ are in the same general Euclidian space. Open questions about these embeddings include their usefulness across classification tasks and the optimal set of documents to build the embeddings. In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of embeddings for improving the state of the art in classification for our tasks and demonstrate that specific word embeddings built in the domain and for the tasks can improve performance over general word embeddings (learnt on news articles, Wikipedia or PubMed).","tags":["Side Project"],"title":"Utility of General and Specific Word Embeddings for Classifying Translational Stages of Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent J.
